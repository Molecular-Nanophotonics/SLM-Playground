# SLM Playground


Some Literature regarding SLM or the calculation of the phase pattern (sometimes called kinofrom):
- "An adaptive approach for uniform scanning in multifocal multiphoton microscopy with a spatial light modulator" here is an example of an somewaht elaborate optical setup; https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-22-1-633&id=276514
- PHD Thesis: "Aberration correction in digital holography" - by Abbie E. Tippie - 2012 - here is some theory, general knowlege and more; https://urresearch.rochester.edu/institutionalPublicationPublicView.action?institutionalItemId=21200
- "Comparison of beam generation techniques using a phase only spatial light modulator" here they sketch six different alogrithems to calculate the phase pattern (and refs for further reading) and compare them in theory and experiment using a certain metric for picture accuracy and the patterns 'efficiency' in thems of summed intensity in the target image; https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-24-6-6249
- "48-spot single-molecule FRET setup with periodic acceptor excitation" here is also an SLM / Microscope setup; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/10/26/156182.full.pdf, plus they put their SLM phase pattern python code up on github: https://github.com/tritemio/lcos_multispot_pattern, Is their setup rather negative example???? (they do not block out the bare reflaction of the SLM)
- "A Practical Algorithm for the Determination of Phase from Image and Diffraction Plane Pictures" The original paper from Gerchenberg and Saxton; http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ppoon/GerchbergandSaxton1972.pdf
