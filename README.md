# SLM Playground

Some Literature regarding SLM or the calculation of the phase pattern (sometimes called kinofrom):


David Grier:
- "Dynamic Holographic Optical Tweezers" - 2002 - from David Grier, here is some math, the setup and optical tweezing with the SLM (spots and vortices) http://physics.nyu.edu/grierlab/dynamic4c/
- "Holographic optical trapping" - 2006 - 3D trapping of coloidal spheres and more http://physics.nyu.edu/grierlab/aoreview3c/
- Talk: "Photokinetic effect" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55XQAXeKpoc

- "Comparison of beam generation techniques using a phase only spatial light modulator" here they sketch six different alogrithems to calculate the phase pattern (and refs for further reading) and compare them in theory and experiment using a certain metric for picture accuracy and the patterns 'efficiency' in thems of summed intensity in the target image; https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-24-6-6249
- "48-spot single-molecule FRET setup with periodic acceptor excitation" here is also an SLM / Microscope setup; https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5000742, plus they put their SLM phase pattern python code up on github: https://github.com/tritemio/lcos_multispot_pattern, Is their setup a rather negative example???? (they do not block out the bare reflaction of the SLM)
